# CMPE-255-Assignment4
Use AI to do data science/coding in chatbot mode

#Assignment 1:

Do data science (ideally deep learning but simpler one is fine) using chatgpt code interpreter by picking a popular data set in kaggle website, upload and do various modules of data science - like my example . Export your chat transcript and submit it. Publish a medium article by selecting sections of the output Generate a nice report - in medium.com. use savegpt extension to export your work to pdf, import and insert any images from chatgpt (screenshot extension) submit the medium article .........

Problem Statement:Sentiment Analysis on Twitter dataset using RNN and LSTM
The aim is to perform sentiment analysis and analyise the data as positive ,negative or neutral.And for this we will follow the CRISP-DM methodology (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to guide our analysis of the Kaggle dataset.

CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is a widely used methodology for data mining and data science projects. It provides a structured approach to planning, executing, and managing data analysis projects. The process consists of six main phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective. Identify the problem to be solved and develop a clear understanding of the project’s goals.

2. **Data Understanding**: Collect initial data, explore it to understand its structure, quality, and relevant features. This phase includes data exploration and discovering insights that inform further steps.

3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and selecting relevant features. This phase can involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating derived variables.

4. **Modeling**: Select and apply various modeling techniques to the prepared data. This phase includes choosing appropriate algorithms, tuning model parameters, and validating model performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance against the business objectives. Determine if the model meets the initial goals and if it’s ready for deployment, or if further iterations are needed.

6. **Deployment**: Implement the model in a production environment. This phase involves delivering the results to stakeholders, integrating the model into existing systems, or creating a reporting structure.

CRISP-DM is iterative; feedback from any phase can lead to revisiting earlier phases. It’s adaptable across different industries and project types, making it a versatile framework for data-related projects.
